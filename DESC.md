# Project Description

## Summary and Purpose
The project is a real-time sign language translation and communication system designed to bridge the one-way communication barrier between American Sign Language (ASL) speakers and those with hearing or sensory impairments. The goal is to provide instant agency to ASL users, fostering independence and reducing reliance on expensive human interpreters for routine tasks. The system analyzes gestures to provide meaning with minimal delay while simultaneously capturing spoken language to transform it into text, creating a truly inclusive environment for deaf, non-speaking, illiterate, and blind individuals.

## Problem Statement

1. The Gap: There is a significant accessibility gap because the vast majority of hearing people lack sign language translation skills, leading to the exclusion and discrimination of vulnerable groups in digital, social, and professional situations.

2. Impacted Groups: Over 70 million deaf people worldwide, plus millions who are non-speaking, illiterate, or blind.

3. Critical Settings: Communication is severely impacted in essential environments like medical clinics, banks, retail stores, and emergency services. Misunderstandings in these high-risk areas can lead to life-threatening situations or economic exploitation.

4. Current Solution Failure: Human translation is expensive ($50-100/hour) and not available 24/7 or in remote areas. Existing AI tools often neglect the specific needs of the non-speaking, illiterate, and blind, and frequently struggle with accuracy (often below 60-70%) in realistic conditions.

5. Severity Statistic: By 2050, nearly 2.5 billion people will suffer from varying degrees of hearing loss. Currently, the ratio of certified interpreters to deaf users is roughly 1:2,500.

## SDG Alignment

1. SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities (Target 10.2): The project promotes social, economic, and political inclusion by treating communication as a fundamental human right and preventing neglect in daily life.

2. SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (Target 9.5): The solution utilizes advanced AI (MediaPipe, TensorFlow) on mobile devices to make high-tech assistance accessible to anyone with a smartphone, regardless of economic status.

## AI Alignment
The project transforms standard smartphone cameras into intelligent communication tools by understanding human movements as language rather than mere pixels. It integrates a "Semantic Layer" using Google Gemini to move beyond word-for-word dictionaries, refining raw sign sequences into natural, grammatically correct English sentences.
